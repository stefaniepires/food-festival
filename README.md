# Food Festival PWA
  
    
  ### Description
  Build a web application for an upcoming three-day food event. The current app loads very slowly when the client simulates a 4G internet connection using Chrome DevTools. The client needs a fast and performant application, especially on mobile, because the app is designed for event attendees who will be using it on their phones.

  ### Concepts
 1. Audit application performance using Google's Lighthouse tool
2. Minify Javascript and Image files
3. Lazy Loading Javascript files
4. Bundle the JavaScript files in an automated approach to code minification (Webpack)
5. Code splitting bundles of JavaScript files to reduce the page-load time
6. How to add reporting tools with plugins to analyze potential problem areas
7. How to split the code to lazily load each code bundle associated with each respective HTML page
8. How to compress images using an image loader
9. Turn App to PWA and have functionality while offline 

  ### Tackling Performance Issues 
Used Lighthouse to run an audit on the page and discovered different metrics about how it performs, as well as what might be hindering its performance
